\section{Effort in Inference}

Due to the sequential nature of the sampling process, the diffusion model is computationally expensive.
Effors have been made to accelerate this process, by resorting to:

\paragraph{High Resolution Image Generation}

lower dimensional latent space \parencite{rombach2022higha}
